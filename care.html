                    Every piece of jewellery is handcrafted in my studio in Copenhagen.<br><br>

                    I strive for my jewellery production to have as little impact on the environment as possible. All my jewellery are therefore made in recycled 925 sterling silver and I use environmentally conscious techniques and chemicals where possible.<br><br>

                    All jewellery are surface treated, which will fade over time. For best maintenance; avoid contact with water or chemical products (such as soap, perfume, hairspray etc.) and keep the jewellery in an air-tight jewellery box when they are not in use.<br><br>

                    If your jewellery need to get its shine back, whether it is in need of a new goldplating, oxidizing or polish, you can always contact me, and we can find a solution.<br><br>

                    I re-polish and re-oxidize all my jewellery free of charge. A new goldplating with 22 karat gold will cost between 50-100 DKK depending on the jewellery.<br><br>
